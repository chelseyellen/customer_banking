# customer_banking
## Introduction
This class challenge was to create classes and assign methods to those classes, then import those classes to then execute a simple customer banking scenario. This exercise incorporated the following areas of knowledge:
* Creating a repository in GitHub
* Importing classes
* Creating functions
* Calling corresponding functions
* Creating a main function to pull it all together
* Submitting this challenge for review

## Results
This class challenge was very difficult - I felt that some of the components took a large leap from what we learned in class to this challenge which required me to do additional research. I am not opposed to that, but it would have been helpful to know that some coding language was new and therefore research was required outside of class materials. I spent a large amount of time sorting through the decks and class recordings looking for a topic, only to realize it was not covered and required me to learn it elsewhere. As mentioned - not an issue, but would have been helpful to know.

## References
In this challenge, I utilized some reference material to assist in completing this homework:
* In class exercises - I accessed the unsolved and solved exercises for Module 3, Class 3 to review classes and the banking exercises we have completed
* I utilized W3 and GeeksforGeeks to explain overarching concepts, such as why "self" is included in classes, what does "if name == main" mean, etc.
